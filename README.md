# Approximate Spark Samples

This repository contains some applications that demonstrate some Spark approximate tools.

**/quantile** contains an example of approximate quantiles applied to a songs dataset.

**/hyperloglog** contains an example of counting distinct elements using HyperLogLog applied to a songs dataset.

**/flights** contains some examples of approximate quantiles and approximate counting applied to a delayed flights dataset.

To run above examples, go to [www.databricks.com], sign up for a community account, paste the codes on Databricks notebooks and run them on a Spark 2.0+ cluster.
