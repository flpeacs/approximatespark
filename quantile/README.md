# Spark Approximate Quantiles Example

Greenwald-Khanna algorithm used to calculate approximate quantiles: http://infolab.stanford.edu/~datar/courses/cs361a/papers/quantiles.pdf

**quantilesExample.py** contains a HyperLogLog execution example on songs times data.

**quantilesDataPlot.r** contains code to plot of approximate quantile outputs on different target residuals.

**quantilesTimePlot.r** contains code to plot of approximate quantile time execution on different target residuals.
